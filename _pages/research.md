# The Effect of Mutation Subtypes on the Allele Frequency Spectrum   
* Synopsis: This works considers the effect of local nucleotide context on the distribution of allele frequencies in a population. Mutation rate heterogeneity and biased gene conversion are two mechanisms that affect the AFS through sequence context. In addition, differences in the AFS among mutation subtypes results in drastically different AFS-based demographic inference methods which suggests current methods are biased by failing to account for local sequence context.

# Identifying Variants Affecting mtDNA Copy Number
* Synposis: This work performed a genome wide association study (GWAS) to identify variants influencing mtDNA copy number. Using data from the 1000g project ...

# Comparing Similarity Measures over RNA-Seq Derived Gene Expression Profiles
*  Synopsis: This works compares 5 similarity measures (Euclidean distance, pearsons correlation, spearmans correlation, median absolute deviation, poisson similarity) and their effect on the performance of a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier. Samples were classified to specific tissue types based on their transcriptome. Ultimately, the commonly used pearsons correlation was found to provide the highest classification accuracy.
